MAIN INFO - About this FORK - UPDATED: 09/23/2011

This fork of Jplayer adds in basic support for RTMP based audio and video (video is currently being developed/tested).

We are working to get it merged in with the master respository and branch that the author Mark J Panaghiston maintains here on GitHub.

Basic support and functionality is in place and working well, including some new advanced features. Additional features listed in the RTMP_NOTES document will come over time.

Please feel free to try this out and post any notes/issues here in the forks issues section.

Thanks!
Rob

Version History:

UPDATE: 09/23/2011

1. The main jquery.jplayer.js version 2.1 dated 09/1/11 has now been merged into this fork, the version #s it requires the SWF to report are still the older versions as those haven't been updated yet, but have also checked in a number of other changes in the ActionScript and SWF's.

2. Temporarily in a state of flux at the moment as I am debugging some issues with LIVE rtmp streams, and adding in a new logging methods via localConnection to pipe logs/debug output to a standalone Adobe AIR based helper app (will commit that source soon).

3. Need to merge in a few changes from the master from the AS3 files, and then they will be pretty much in sync again, and will consider sending a new push Request to Mark.

4. Added support for re-using existing netConnection if only the stream/file has changed

5. Added some workarounds for rapid successive setMedia requests

6. Added some tweaks for proper LIVE rtmp stream support (bufferTime and bufferTimeMax settings for LIVE streams)

7. Added in a new helper class to support sending log/debug info over localConnection to a companion helper app written in Adobe AIR. Will check in the sources for it shortly. At the moment many log and debugevents are commented out.
