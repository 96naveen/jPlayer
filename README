UPDATE: 09/23/2011
The main jquery.jplayer.js has now been merged into this fork, the version #s it requires the SWF to report are still the older versions as those haven't been updated yet, but have also checked in a number of other changes in the ActionScript and SWF's.
In a state of flu at the moment as I am debugging some issues with LIVE rtmp streams, and adding in a new logging methods via localConnection to pipe logs/debug output to a standalone Adobe AIR based helper app (will commit that source soon).
Need to merge in a few changes from the master from the AS3 files, and then they will be pretty much in sync again, and will consider sending a new push Request to Mark.


UPDATE: 09/21/2011
Jplayer 2.1 is available now - will be merging 2.1 with this fork and checking in some updates and bug fixes soon - hang tight..

MAIN INFO - UPDATED: 08/18/2011

This fork of Jplayer adds in basic support for RTMP based audio and video (video is currently being tested).

We are working to get it merged in with the master respository and branch that the author Mark J Panaghiston maintains here on GitHub.

As of now, the fork relies on version 2.0.21 of jquery.jplayer.js
and 2.0.26 of the ActionScript source. Somewhere after 2.0.21 the changes to jquery.jplayer.js are causing issues with duration and current time updates, so we are going to freeze on that version until 2.1 is released and then revisit the changes.

Basic support and functionality is in place and working well - additional features listed below will come over time. Please feel free to try this out and post any notes/issues here in the forks issues section.

Thanks!
Rob
